Project 1. Landing Page
I have created a landing page based on a comic book / manga store and merchandising
---
Description: 
In this project you will apply all the knowledge you have learnt so far.

The page to be made, can be of the theme you choose, but we provide you with a design so that you can get an idea of what we want, you can replicate it and we advise you to do it in the first projects so that you can focus on doing it well and then you will do freer projects, although if you want to do something special go ahead.

PROPOSED DESIGN:

Remember to use the HTML validator to avoid making mistakes: https://validator.w3.org/

For the delivery, you just need to upload your project to github and provide us with the link in the input on the right.

Good luck!
